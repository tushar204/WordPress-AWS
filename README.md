A UserData or manually executed script that updates your OS, downloads and installs WordPress, MySQL, and PHP5, secures the MySQL installation, and configures WordPress for your chosen credentials. This fully automated script works for Amazon Linux, RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu on AWS.

I'm doing this exclusively as a learning experience for both AWS and the different flavors of Linux, so if you see any errors, my comments are inaccurate, etc, please let me know.
